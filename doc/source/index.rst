ngs_mapper
=============

**Version**: |release|

The ngs_mapper is a configurable pipeline next generation sequence pipeline that aims to be easy for the bioinformatician to install as well as use.
It focuses on documentation as well as easy configuration and running. The pipeline is also meant to get you from data to completed genome as easy as possible.

The documentation is a work-in-progress as the aim is to keep it as much up-to-date as possible with the pipeline as it changes. If anything seems out of place or wrong
please open a bug report on `github <https://github.com/VDBWRAIR/ngs_mapper/issues>`_
