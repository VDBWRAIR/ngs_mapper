Vagrantfile
===========

This is the configuration file for `Vagrant <http://www.vagrantup.com>`_
It instructs vagrant on how to provision each of the virtual machines.

Essentially it brings up whichever vagrant box you tell it in the vagrant up command.
It ensures that any OS dependant things are handled prior to running :py:mod:`.vagrant-provision`
When it is finished the Vagrant box you bring up should have the pipeline and all dependencies completely installed

You refer to this machine using centos65 in any of the vagrant commands:
