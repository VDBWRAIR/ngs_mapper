Creating Issues
===============

Since the source code for this project is hosted on GitHub, it also comes with an issue tracker.

All feature requests, bugs and other communications are all kept there. This gives both the developers and users a common place to
discuss all aspects of the pipeline as well as give a nice resource to help find answers to questions that might have already been asked.

Submitting a Bug
----------------

First, please make sure you read through the :doc:`FAQ <help>` and also do a search for `existing similar issues <https://github.com/VDBWRAIR/miseqpipeline/issues?q=is%3Aissue>`_

If you can't find anything in either of those sources that address your issue, then go ahead and create a `New Issue <https://github.com/VDBWRAIR/miseqpipeline/issues/new>`_

Make sure to include the following information:

* Description of the error that you are encountering
* The command you ran that generated the error
* Any pertinant information about the issue

You may be asked later to attach files from your project so don't delete any of the files yet.
